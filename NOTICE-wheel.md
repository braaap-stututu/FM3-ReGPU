# Notice: racing wheel support

The racing wheel logic in `src/input/wheel/` (which device is the wheel, the pedals, the shifter
and the handbrake; the H-pattern shifter, clutch and analog handbrake; the 900 and 270 degree
steering modes; the known-device tables) is ported from the racing wheel driver of
**Forza Horizon 1: ReImagined** (https://github.com/FH1-ReImagined/ForzaHorizon1-ReImagined), its
ReXGlue SDK patch series `patches/rexglue-sdk/0074`, `0099`, `0101`, `0127`, `0128`, `0129`,
`0131`, `0132`, `0133`, `0134` and `0135`. The force feedback (`src/input/wheel/wheel_ff.h`,
`src/kernel/imports_ff.cpp`) comes from `0101`, `0129` and `0131`. Those files carry the BSD 3-Clause License, reproduced below. The
DirectInput device layer (`wheel_system.cpp`), the launcher probe (`wheel_probe.cpp`) and the
launcher's Wheel stuff tab (`launcher/FM3Launcher/Wheel.cs`, `wwwroot/wheel.js`) are new code of the FM4 ReGPU fork
for this project.

The `fm2` force feedback playback (`wheel_ffb_mode = fm2` in `wheel_system.cpp`) follows Forza
Motorsport 2 ReGPU's `src/input/wheel.cpp` (https://github.com/zer0ducksgiven/Forza-Motorsport-2-ReGPU,
MIT, by the same author as this project's base): its easing, fades, strengths and no rumble.

The device tables in those files credit their own sources: JacKeTUs/simracing-hwdb, Project Motor
Racing's device maps (Apkallu-Industries/Pitwall), gotzl/hid-fanatecff, mherbold/SimagicHPR, and
Logitech's and PCGamingWiki's button tables.
